# CSI-ComSensing-AE

This the Tensorflow implementation of paper ``Acquiring Measurement Matrices via Model-Based Deep Learning for Sparse Channel Estimation in mmWave Massive MIMO Systems"


## Environment

1. Python 3 
2. Tensorflow 
3. Gurobi
4. Matlab


## Reproduce results steps

To reproduce our results, follow the three steps:
1. Prepare dataset, please refer to the details in the below section "Dataset"  
2. Run the script channel_main_call.sh in terminal
3. Read the results by running readres.py

## Built With

* [DeepMIMO](https://www.deepmimo.net/) - for Dataset Generation
